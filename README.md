Implement a sample machine learning program for a problem statement of your choice.

## Project : Credit card fraud detection using Machine Learning with Python


## Introduction
The credit card fraud detection features uses user behavior and location scanning to check for unusual patterns.
These patterns include user characteristics such as user spending patterns as well as usual user geographic locations to verify his identity.

Due to Behavior and location analysis approach, there is a drastic reduction in the number of False Positives transactions identified as malicious by an FDS although they are actually genuine..
The system stores previous transaction patterns for each user.
Based upon previous data of that user the system recognizes unusual patterns in the payment procedure.
The System will block the user for more than 3 invalid attempts.
